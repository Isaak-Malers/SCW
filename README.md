# Shaft Collar Weapon STL's

![Exploded View](./Readme-photo.png)


# Parts Required for Included design:
* 40mm length M3 countersunk bolts
* M3 Nylock nuts
* 608 "Skateboard" ball bearings
* Requisite size steel shaft collar
* Requisite size countersunk bolt, Length should be the shortest size that still sits proud of the inner race of the shaft collar.
* 1/8 diameter O-Ring, sized so that it stretches around 30% when stretched onto both pulleys.

# Integration Requirements:
* Weapon motor/pulley, I've included STL's for the pulley I use.  Which mates to a GARTT 2212 920kv motor with the plain can (no integrated prop addapter)
* 8mm weapon shaft/spacers/mounting

# Design Recomendations:
* The 2 inch shaft collar + hub weighs just shy of 20oz.
* The 1.875 shaft collar + hub weighs just shy of 17oz.
* The motor I reccomend with the included pulley STL's is capable of starting from stall with the robot sitting with 100% of its weight on the weapon (at 4s, 30a esc)
* I reccomend spinning the weapon around 2,500-7,000 rpm, Faster speeds typically throw O-rings, and because the mass/moment of the weapon is so optimized, it really doesn't need crazy RPM's to do damage.
* Note that the hub includes 2 pulleys for 2 O-rings.  For higher tip speeds, I've used dual 2212 1400kv motors to increase the power to the weapon.
